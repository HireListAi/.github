# Welcome to HireList.Ai

## Guidlines

- Keep It Simple, Stupid!
- Follow Clean Code
- Test if you think it makes sense, usually starting with tests for API Endpoints.
- Lets build fast, know our stack, innovate when necessary but otherwise use established standards.

## Infrastructure

Basically all the infrastructure should be hosted on either GCP or our dedicated servers. 
On GCP we focus mostly on Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, and Pub/Sub; we usually avoid more expensive stuff like Cloud Functions and Compute Engine.

In order to deploy infrastrucutre terraform and github-actions shall be used. Service related infrastructure should be placed within the service's repository. General infrastrucutre in the [gcp-bootstrap repo](https://github.com/HireList.Ai/gcp-bootstrap).
